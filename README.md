Brief Description:
This program is an advanced analyzer tool for processing Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and X-ray Diffraction (XRD) data, developed with a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Key features include:

Fourier Transform (FFT) and Inverse Fourier Transform (iFFT) for signal analysis

Fourier Series with adjustable term counts

Advanced FTIR/XRD Analysis including peak detection, K-Means clustering, and result visualization

Support for uploading data files (CSV, Excel, text) and generating custom signals

Interactive plotting using the matplotlib library

--> <b>Two real-world sample datasets included for testing and demonstration</b>
